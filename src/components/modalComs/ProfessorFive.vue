    <p class="self"><b>Dr. Dries Braeken</b> obtained his PhD degree in Medical Sciences from the KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2009 in collaboration with IMEC. From 2009 to 2012 he worked as senior scientist in the Bioelectronics group in IMEC. In 2012 he became R&D Team Leader in the Life Science Technologies department in IMEC and in 2017 R&D manager and group leader. His research focuses on the development of CMOS multi-electrode arrays using silicon fabrication processes and electrophysiological characterization of cell-electrode interfaces. He has (co-) authored over 45 publications and 7 patents. He has managed several Flemish and international public funded projects as well as bilateral contracts.</p>
