    <p class="self"><b>Chiara Bartolozzi</b> (IEEE Member) is researcher at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. She earned a degree in Engineering (with honors) at University of Genova (Italy) and a Ph.D. in Neuroinformatics at ETH Zurich, developing analog subthreshold circuits for emulating biophysical neuronal properties onto silicon and modelling selective attention on hierarchical multi-chip systems. She is currently leading the Event Driven Perception for Robotics group (www.edpr.iit.it), mainly working on the application of the "neuromorphic" engineering approach to the design of sensors and algorithms for robotic perception. She is chair of the Neuromorphic Systems and Application Technical Committee of IEEE CAS.</p>
