        title: 'Presentation Attacks and its Countermeasures on Biometric Authentication Systems',
        content: `Prof. Tetsushi Ohki, Shizuoka University, Japan`,
        dialog: `With the advent of new technologies, the methods of presentation attacks as well as the security measures taken against it is diversifying with each passing day and are competing with each other. The imposter can make an access to a system illegally by deceiving the security through the use of material containing artificial biometrics traits like a printed photo, display and so on. 
        This talk will start with an overview of researches on biometrics and machine learning security. Then introduce the-state-of-the-art presentation attacks and its countermeasures including novel presentation attack detection algorithm which can ensure security against unknown presentation attacks without any prior knowledge of fake samples.`,

        dialog: `Currently, multielectrode arrays (MEAs) are being combined with CMOS electronics in an effort to convert conventional passive neural probes and MEAs into more sophisticated devices. This migration, mainly motivated by the need of proximity between electrodes and circuitry, and the increasing density in multielectrode arrays are generating important circuit design challenges as regards miniaturization, noise and power dissipation reduction, programmability and handling of large quantity of output data. By combining IC design and advanced micro-fabrication, it is possible to develop high-density devices that can record the activity of hundreds of individual cells, in real time. This talk provides an overview of such devices and their design challenges.`

        dialog: `With a growing world population and increasing life span, the future challenges for our healthcare system are tremendous. In some countries, total spending on healthcare will pass over 20% of the GDP. At the same time, diseases such as cancer and dementia are affecting millions of people worldwide. To tackle these challenges, better technologies are needed, in order to diagnose faster, predict and treat better. In this presentation, I will highlight imec’s mission to develop novel technologies to tackle some of these grand challenges. For example, implantable stimulation devices already help patients with hearing loss, pain, tremor, and even depression. But better devices are needed to increase success rates and decrease undesired side effects. In imec we develop silicon-based devices to meet tomorrow’s standards for implantables. Another technology platform where silicon can make a difference is the in vitro cell based multielectrode array chips. Cell cultures based on patient material form an easily accessible platform for the study of fundamental neuroscience questions, but also assess drug adversity in drug development processes.`,

        dialog: `Autonomy (in robotics) brings about a number of technical requirements depending on whether we consider power consumption and computational autonomy that lead to untethered machines, or rather behavioral autonomy, whereby robots take autonomous decisions based on set goals and real-time interaction with the environment. In practice, the key to any autonomy is information encoding. Efficient encoding of sensory signals allows for an optimal representation of information, reducing the cost of acquiring, transmitting and storing unnecessary data, and simultaneously allowing for a better extraction of relevant information, which in turn enables more robust decision-making.
        Biological systems are autonomous in the sense described above, as evolution developed computational strategies for making sense of the external noisy and ambiguous signals to produce appropriate behavior in real time, at the lowest possible energetic cost and using an inhomogeneous substrate for computation comprising slow and stochastic elements. The properties of biological systems are a reference point for the realization of robots that face similar computational and energetic constraints and have to replicate basic human skills for reliable and robust interaction with the environment and cooperation with humans. 
        Event-Driven Perception has the potential to induce a paradigm shift in robotics, based on the biologically inspired emerging concept of event-driven sensing and processing that leads to better robots able to acquire, transmit and process information only when needed, optimizing the use of resources, leading to real-time, low-cost, operation.`,

        title: `Deep Brain Stimulation In Parkinson’s Disease: From Bench To Beside`,
        content: `Prof. Abdelhamid Benazzou, University of Bordeaux, France`,
        dialog: `Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the manifestation of motor symptoms, which are mainly attributed to the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the pars compacta of substantia nigra. Based on advancements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, especially in animal models, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been pointed as a major target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of motor symptoms, first developed in non-human primate and then successfully transfered to parkinsonian patients. However, the mechanisms of action underlying its therapeutic effectiveness are complex and still under debate. Majority of electrophysiological studies, including ours, have shown an inhibition of the neuronal activity during DBS of the target nuclei in rodents and MPTP non-human primates. The decrease of firing rate is accompanied by a desynchronization of burst oscillatory activity in the STN and the output nuclei of basal ganglia. HFS may elicit a direct effect on local cells, which occurs as a result of the field application to the neural membrane. However, DBS may also drive neural activity by exciting afferent and efferent projections from targeted regions as well as en passant fibers. By doing so, action potentials may propagate anterogradely or retrogradely, modulating activity in structures at a distance from the target. In addition, DBS, especially of the STN, directly influence the cerebral cortex antidromically via the corticofugal axons, which pass under the STN projecting to the brainstem and spinal cord, and the fibers of the "hyperdirect" pathway projecting from the cortex to the STN. Antidromic activation of the layer V cortico-fugal projection neurons in the motor cortex contributes to the disruption of abnormal neural activities in 6-OHDA rats. In conclusion, DBS exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple complex mechanisms characterized not only by inhibition or excitation of the target nuclei and the downstream structures, but also changes in the firing pattern and other phenomena such as changes in glial activity, synaptic transmission, neuroplasticity with increased neurogenesis, augmented levels of trophic factors, changes in the expression of receptors and the volume of brain structures. Better understanding mechanisms associated with DBS may refine its use and improve the efficacy of this therapy.`,
